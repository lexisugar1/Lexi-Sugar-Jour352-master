Beauty allows us to shape our individual stories and find ways to connect to others all at once. With The Top Shelf we discover personal narratives through beauty routines. In The Beauty Politic, Into The Gloss explores how beauty connects communities, and how it informs a sense of self for the people within them. Beauty can be used as a tool not just for self-expression, but for empowerment and preservation as well.

  Let's say you wanted to be a lawyer, or a doctor, or a beauty writer (hey, why not!) when you grew up. It probably wasn't something you had to start thinking seriously about until at least college—professional athletes, on the other hand, commit to their crafts way before they're even old enough to drive. The lifestyle of a professional athlete is defined by their sport, and in celebration of Glossier's new Body Hero Exfoliating Bar and Dry-Touch Oil Mist (and official partnership with the WNBA), ITG spoke to eight WNBA players about the ways they get beauty to work for them. From fighting preconceived notions about what it means to be a woman in sports, to the best tricks for game-ready makeup, these players have a thing or two to say about caring for bodies that have to keep going, and going. We'll let them explain.

  “I’ve had both fans and haters from a very young age. When I was around 10 I started playing on boys’ teams and I dunked on some kid in my first game—after that the gym was packed for every game. I was on the cover of Sports Illustrated when I was 14, and that’s not me bragging—a lot of negativity started coming my way and I didn't know how to process it. I started researching how to release energy, how to transform it and utilize it, and meditation was something that came up. During those early days I would meditate to songs I could relate to, and that would bring me some calm. And as I got more into it, I came across frequency beats. I’d put my headphones on and just sit for 10 or 20 minutes to find my peace before I entered practice or a game. I love how my body is able to feel vibrations and connect with source energy.
<br>
<br>
Women in sports already get trolled for nothing, so of course we also get trolled when our beauty isn’t on point. A few years ago they wanted us to wear skimpier uniforms, and it really made us more self-conscious. It's very hard to go to work and do the job that we do and look like a beauty queen. Now I wash my face with cold water and apply the Glossier Futuredew oil serum. I like the way it makes my skin feel, and how it’s not as thick as lotion. Before that, I would always check to see if I had dry skin hanging from my nose or somewhere around my eyes. And now I don’t leave the house feeling dry—I have a glow.
<br>
<br>
I’ve had locs for 10 years. Every three months I do a detox—I fill the sink with water and put in a little apple cider vinegar, baking soda, and lemon juice. I let my hair sit in that mixture for 15 to 20 minutes, then I wash and condition it, and it really does make my hair feel a lot softer and look a lot fluffier. I got my locs touched up right before I went into the Wubble, but about a month in they were grown out. One of my teammates noticed and cleaned them up for me. I have over a hundred locs in my head, and it’s so much work—I don’t even like to do it for myself! That was really great.”
