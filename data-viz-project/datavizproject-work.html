Beauty allows us to shape our individual stories and find ways to connect to others all at once. With The Top Shelf we discover personal narratives through beauty routines. In The Beauty Politic, Into The Gloss explores how beauty connects communities, and how it informs a sense of self for the people within them. Beauty can be used as a tool not just for self-expression, but for empowerment and preservation as well.

  Let's say you wanted to be a lawyer, or a doctor, or a beauty writer (hey, why not!) when you grew up. It probably wasn't something you had to start thinking seriously about until at least college—professional athletes, on the other hand, commit to their crafts way before they're even old enough to drive. The lifestyle of a professional athlete is defined by their sport, and in celebration of Glossier's new Body Hero Exfoliating Bar and Dry-Touch Oil Mist (and official partnership with the WNBA), ITG spoke to eight WNBA players about the ways they get beauty to work for them. From fighting preconceived notions about what it means to be a woman in sports, to the best tricks for game-ready makeup, these players have a thing or two to say about caring for bodies that have to keep going, and going. We'll let them explain.

  “I’ve had both fans and haters from a very young age. When I was around 10 I started playing on boys’ teams and I dunked on some kid in my first game—after that the gym was packed for every game. I was on the cover of Sports Illustrated when I was 14, and that’s not me bragging—a lot of negativity started coming my way and I didn't know how to process it. I started researching how to release energy, how to transform it and utilize it, and meditation was something that came up. During those early days I would meditate to songs I could relate to, and that would bring me some calm. And as I got more into it, I came across frequency beats. I’d put my headphones on and just sit for 10 or 20 minutes to find my peace before I entered practice or a game. I love how my body is able to feel vibrations and connect with source energy.
<br>
<br>
Women in sports already get trolled for nothing, so of course we also get trolled when our beauty isn’t on point. A few years ago they wanted us to wear skimpier uniforms, and it really made us more self-conscious. It's very hard to go to work and do the job that we do and look like a beauty queen. Now I wash my face with cold water and apply the Glossier Futuredew oil serum. I like the way it makes my skin feel, and how it’s not as thick as lotion. Before that, I would always check to see if I had dry skin hanging from my nose or somewhere around my eyes. And now I don’t leave the house feeling dry—I have a glow.
<br>
<br>
I’ve had locs for 10 years. Every three months I do a detox—I fill the sink with water and put in a little apple cider vinegar, baking soda, and lemon juice. I let my hair sit in that mixture for 15 to 20 minutes, then I wash and condition it, and it really does make my hair feel a lot softer and look a lot fluffier. I got my locs touched up right before I went into the Wubble, but about a month in they were grown out. One of my teammates noticed and cleaned them up for me. I have over a hundred locs in my head, and it’s so much work—I don’t even like to do it for myself! That was really great.”

  “I grew up in Orlando, moved to Atlanta to play on a team there, went to college in Maryland, and then after two seasons I transferred to Duke. Basketball was my constant. You have to be 22 the year of the draft—for most players that's after your senior year. Because I had one more year until I turned 22, I did a master's program at the business school. There were so many nights of tears and mental breakdowns, but two of my teammates and one of our managers were in the program with me, and we helped each other through it. After I retire from basketball, I would love to have a position where I could use statistics to help teams make decisions. I think that's something I would be really good at.
  <br>
  <br>
In terms of beauty, I like whatever makes my life easier. I started doing eyelash extensions three years ago and it changed everything for me. When I'm in Minnesota I have a girl that comes to me, but when I’m in Atlanta I go to Lashtyp. For my hair, I usually get a sew-in—I couldn’t go get it touched up when I was in the Wubble, and it was actually kind of a blessing because I learned how to finesse my own hair. I brought bundles with me and started watching YouTube videos, and suddenly ponytails seemed so self-explanatory—like, why did I not think of ponytails earlier? I tried to maintain my nails in the Wubble too, because acrylics help me not bite them, but that one I failed at. I bought some press-ons that did not last through one practice. I brought little gel nail polishes just to keep my nails painted, but they looked disgusting. Actually, one of my friends who plays for the Sparks, Reshanda, brought a whole nail set and gave me a full manicure, with tips and everything. She did a really good job, but it took three hours—I didn’t make her do them again after that.
<br>
<br>
I love massages, but they’re so expensive. If I'm sore I'll usually just work it out—my recovery process is staying as active as possible. We have a Peloton bike in the garage, so I'll just hop on that. Robin is my favorite instructor—she has the hardest classes by far. I love that my body can just keep going. I see regular people take simple falls and they're like, down for forever. But with athletes, you’d have to do something insane. We keep on getting up.”
